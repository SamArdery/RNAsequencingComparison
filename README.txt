This folder contains the scripts required to perform RNA-seq alignment and quantificantion on DO mESC samples either using
paired-end or single-end sequencing with Bowtie or STAR (SE only)

*Note*: The RunOneSamples scripts will not work as is, so therefore the run_all_sampeles scripts won't work. In order to 
make these scripts work, please enter in your own personal fastscratch directory where the -- are in the make temporary 
directory portion (Line 28 in SE scripts, line 29 in PE script)
