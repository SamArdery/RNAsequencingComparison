# RNAseq_comp
Repo for comparing eQTL results from RNA-seq counts obtained from single and paired-end reads

A little tour of this directory:
Comparisons: This folder contains all of the information in regards to the main analysis performed in this study. This includes the Expression, eQTL, and STAR comparisons.
data: This just holds a few csvs with random data that was collected for various small checks
DataCollection: This folder holds all of the scripts to actually collect the expression data from the alignment files. It also holds some of the mapping data 
LogData: This folder is where the alignment metadata is collected from all three data sets
Mapping Scripts: This is where the scripts for eQTL mapping are located as well as the required data
PaperFiguresSVG: This is the svg files of all the figures used for the paper
renv: This is where the renv stuff is. I am not positive what it does but I am scared to remove it. 
SideComparisons: This just a few smaller comparisons completed throughout the process like the mismatch allowance test and the emase x bowtie comparisons

The files are the actual R project, as well as a few things to make the project work

While writing this read me I was listening to Lola Montez and Dagen For by Volbeat. Solid song.
